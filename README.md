Annotations :

    Difference between @Bean and @Autowired
        - @Bean : tells spring 'here is an instance of a class, keep a hold of it and give it to me when i ask for it'
    
        - @Autowired : tells spring, provide me the instance of the class that I had created earlier with @bean annotation.
    
    @Configuration : indicates that a class declares one or more @Bean methods
